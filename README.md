## Cafe Location Scouting - Manhattan
[click here for blog post](https://jrduane.medium.com/cafe-location-scouting-in-manhattan-with-data-8609d74e9123)
For this project we help find the best area in Downtown Manhattan to open a new cafe using Foursquare location data and data scraped from [Restaurant Business Online's future 50 restaurants.](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/future-50-2020) and made available via Michal Bogacz on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020).  This list includes fifty restaurants that were able to successfully grow their operations during a difficult period in the industry, and were chosen for their ability to adapt and likeliness to continue to excel in the future. 
As Manhattan is a pretty saturated market for cafes and is an expensive area to operate in, it is crucial for to gain a deeper understanding of the market we are entering. Using location data from currently successful restaurant operations, we can re cluster Manhattan based on the locations of these high volume restaurants rather than the neighborhoods they fall in, which may give us a different understanding of where people are going out to eat.
Our goal is to use data and clustering to find a high volume area that is the least saturated with cafes and coffee shops on our list. By positioning the new cafe near other high volume locations, we may be able to capitalize on existing traffic trends.
